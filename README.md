# Generative Adversarial Network
Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is a deep neural network architecture that helps us to generate new samples given the training examples. Its a combination of two network a) Generative network and b) discriminative network. Generative network tries to generate the fake samples (synthetic samples), by drawing a sample point from a latent space (n dimensional gaussian vector space) and then expanding it to reconstruct the new sample point that looks similar comparing to the real samples (training samples). While on the other hand discriminative network tries to classify the samples both generated by the generative network and the real examples to the fake and real classes. The discriminative network solve this problem as a binary classification problem (0 means fake and 1 means real). This is one of the reason, we use sigmoid as a activation function at the output layer. 

We used three different kinds of networks to solve problem 1, 2, and 3. 
1. **One Dimensional Gan (1DGAN):** We use GAN to approximate the point of a quadratic equation.  
2. **Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN):** We use GAN to approximate the point of a quadratic equation.  
3. **Conditional GAN (cGAN):** We use GAN to approximate the point of a quadratic equation.
